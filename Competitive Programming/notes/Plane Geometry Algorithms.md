# Plane Geometry Algorithms

### Geometry Algorithms
- Show up every now and again
	- 0 - 1 questions per contest
- Almost always 2D plane geometry

#### Key Challenges
- Remembering/deriving formulas 

Examples

- Blast Zone
	- Given
		- List of points (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)
		- Epicenter (cx, cy)
		- Radis r
	- Count number of points distance <= r from epicenter
	- All input ints between -2<sup>15</sup> and 2<sup>15</sup>

- Convex Hull
	- Find a point on the boundary
	- Walk around the boundary to find the greatest area
